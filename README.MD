# Life game

This is a little implementation of the well known life game algorithm. This programm is in C and should run easily on macOS and Linux.

## Build

All the tools needed are, or should be, natively present on ubuntu and macOS:

* GCC compiler
* `sudo apt install gcc`
* imageMagik package 
* `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`

## Run

Make life_game.sh bash script executable
* `chmod 765 life_game.sh`
Then run it with three arguments: the size of the grid, the number of steps, and the pattern to start with.
* `./langton_ant.sh 20 100 3`

Thanks
